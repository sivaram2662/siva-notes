Microsoft Azure
===============
AAD
VMS
VMSS
Azure Load Balancer
Application Gateway
Traffic Manager
Front Door and CDN(CloudFront)
DNS Zones
Vnets
Storage Accounts
App Service : Its Paas. will deploy web apps
Functions   : Consumption serverless (Particular Time)/App service Plan(Continuosly running) like aws lambda
Logic Apps  : Step by step process (Trigger/Scheduling)
Service Bus : Topic(Single sender to multiple receivers) and Queue(Single sender to single receiver)


authenticate azure to azure devops/outside like terraform/python 
1. service principal (will create in azure active directory level)
2. managed identity (system identity (when you delete resource it will delete) / user defined identity (when you delete resource it won't delete will go for manual)) (will create in resource level)

Example:
--------
It will create manage identity generates object id in app service will copy to paste in azure key vault access policies then establish the connection.


Azure Cost calculator
----------------------
It will give the cost estimation of azure resources in dollars.


Storage Account
----------------
will store data like files, images, videos.
two types of storage accounts like standard and premium
Redudancy types like local redudant storage(LRS), geo-redudant storage(GRS), Read-Write GRS (RA-GRS) and Zone Redudant Storage (ZRS).

LRS    ---> Primary and secondary within the one region only. when primary is down still able to acess storage account (Single Region)
GRS    ---> Primary and Secondary within multi Regions. MS decides to create Storage account in nearest region of primary (Multi Regions)
RA-GRS ---> Primary and Seconday but secondary will have read only access
ZRS    ---> Data will be stored in multiple zones.

storage account advanced concept is "Data lake". it stores historical data. when you enable premium then go a head.

data protection  --> enable point-in-time restore(7days) for containers(folder)----> (recovery)

enable soft-delete for blobs(files) ---> (Retain 7-365 days)

enable versioning for blobs

enable blob change feed --- tracking like who create, modified and delete

type of storage account:
-----------------------
containerss(blob) storage  --> means unstructured data like files, logs, binary data, images, videos, vhd 
file share means nfs --> create file share(folder) in azure and you can mount file share in your local machine --> not store vhd info
table storage  ---> pure development
queue storage  ---> pure development

Access tiers
cool    ---> access data from local to cloud storage (infrequently access data)
hot     ---> frequently accessing the data
archieve---> when you want to roll back your storage accounts (like recycle bin)

Iam -- owner, contributor (use the resources but he doesnt give access to others), reader

data migration ---> data migrating from on-premises(local machine) to azure cloud storage account via "az copy"

data transformation ---> data migrating from one storage account to anothet storage account

az copy
storage explorer 

authenticate to azure cloud storage account via az copy (or) storage explorer --> connection string, SAS, secrets
By using az copy will use auth method called shared access signature (SAS) -- SAS Token
By using storage explorer will use auth method called shared access signature (SAS) -- Blob SAS URL

blob types ---> page blobs(vhd info), append blobs(log info) and block blobs

life cycle management ---> to redcue the cost 
static website        ---> single page application (create container $web inside we have to create page.html, error.html)
alerts                ---> generic alerts and metric alerts (Average within 5mins how many times it fails)
alerts configure      ---> azure resource manager role / email sms alert

access keys   -->  create access key 
object replication   ---> we have to replicate data from one storage account container($web) to another storage account container

CORS ---> Cross regional replication
storage account data is in one one domain can acess resources to another storage account data in another domain
cors provides a secure way to allow one domain(the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain

configuration --> change the existing conf of storage account like lrs, access tiers, encryption.

networks ---> public networks, selected nwtworks

Locks  ---> Read-only and delete (user will not able to delete)

Recover deleted account  ---> last 14days like recycle bin

new support request ---> raise a issue based on which service, which resource and problem type

Events  ---> When any action performs immeditely another action will do.



Recovery services vault -- backup service
-----------------------
to take the backup of vms, storage accounts..etc



App Service(webapp) --> to deploy web apps
-------------------
app service plan (server)    ---> its backend of app service  ---> increase/decrease performance
application insights         ---> moniotoring

app service plan --> dev/test, pro and isolation

Deployment slots --> Zero down time and roll back 

Scale Up   -----> Change the configuration (app service plan)

Scale Down -----> Increase/Decrease the Instances based on cpu and memory (manual scale and auto scale)

Deployment center ---> via FTP creds, Source code like git,bitbucket,gitlab,azure repos

Advanced tools         -----> (kudu) (or) winscp 
App service Editor

Console   ----> will see deployment files in console via cli

Custom domains  ----> add custom domain and map to godaddy and update records

App service logs ---> enable application logging

Log stream ---->  Application Logs and web server logs

Extentions --->  like anti virus malware, site replicator...etc

clone APP ----> create new app service with existing config

change app service plan 

properties ----> outbound app addresses, resource id, location, subscription name, rg and some...

backups  ---->  backup everyday store in storage account and retention period is 30days

authentication ---> add identity provider like gmail sign in, facebook sign in give app registration details like client id, client secret (developers)

configuration  --->  change application settings and general settings (you can acces from one service to another in configuartions via connection string)

application insights ---> monitoring


Azure Key Vault
----------------
store keys, certs and secrets like username, passwords for security

pricing tier ---> standard and premium

Enabled soft-delete means recovery (7 to 90 days)

Access Policy  ----> Enable access to vms, arm templates and volumes ---> vault access policy and azure role based access control

add acess policy  ---> keys, secrets and certs like get, list, update, create import and delete via service principal

secrets/certs ---> generate/import secret add key value with expiry date  ---> it takes latest version

App service  <--------> establish connection <------> key vault via identity (system assigned/user assigned) generates object id

take object id and copies to access polcies of azure key vault via service principal



Sql server
----------
store structured format data like rows and columns

create sql server   ---> we dont create any database in sql server
create sql database ---> it have data

firewalls and virtual networks ---> allow and add ips to access the server ---> to block the internet request to connect your sql server

auditing ---> basically used to track your activities in sql server or database which is done by the user

types of database sku's
basic
standard
premium

query editor ---> you can query in database like create table, insert data...etc

connect from local tool mssm (microsoft sql server managament studio) to azure sql server in remote.

types of access management
window based login  --->  server created in local machine itself and connect from local
sql based dlogin    --->  server created in azure and connect from local (not recommended to give access in real time)
AAD based Login     --->  server created in azure and connect from local (login with individual email)

create login at server level  --> create login bharath with password = "Admin@123"

create user to access db in existing login user at db level --> create login bharath with password = "Admin@123" create user bharath for login bharath

set azure active directory admin email to sql server

create user [aad_email] from external provider


VM's
----
Availability Options 
1. no infra redudancy required 
2. availability zone (fault (in one rack will create vms with same config)and update domains (in one rack will create vms with diff config))
3. availability set (will create across zones)
4. vmss (distribute vms across zones and fault domains at scale) increase vms based on cpu and memory

disks type
os disk (os+softwares) ---> hdd(stores inbuilt disk--->increase or decrese size), ssd(stores in storage account-->page blobs(vhd)-->it can change automatic by size for data)
data disk (data)

size --> we can modify size. vm is in stopped state

Reset password --> with new one

Run command --> without loginto the server you should run commands via powershell commnds

change tracking ---> logs log analytics workspace

identity  ---> system and user assigned identity



Vnet
-----
Its own representation of private cloud where we can create our private networks and restrict.

we need two components for vnets
--------------------------------
1. address space (boundary of network means cidr range how many ips you want) --> ipv4(10.0.0.0) -- 32bit and ipv6(combination of alpha numeric) -- 128bit

10.1.0.0/16  ==> 16 means prefix (or) subnet mask ==> 2 power 16 ==> 65536 ips 

2. subnet (we can connect our virtual machines to vnets via subnet only)

10.1.0.0/24  ==> 2 power 8 ==> 256 ips

In Azure cloud Every subnet reserved 5 ips for pulic ips etc...

public subnet (internet anyone can access)
private subnet (intranet within the network only can access)

Most of times will use A, B, C Classes
--------------------------------------
Class A --> 0 - 127
Class B --> 128 - 191
Class C --> 192 - 223
Class D --> 224 - 239
Class E --> 240 - 255

Private Address Ranges
-----------------------
Class A: 10.0. 0.0 to 10.255. 255.255.
Class B: 172.16. 0.0 to 172.31. 255.255.
Class C: 192.168. 0.0 to 192.168. 255.255.


Network security groups
------------------------
we can allow ports and ips to nsg who enters into our private network
inbound rules (incoming request)
outbound rules (outgoing request)


Virtual Network Gateways (diff regions) 
---------------------------------------
It Enables the security.
Scenario1: web application is in south india and database is in north europe then we can establish the connection by using virtual network gateway.

Scenario2: web application is in east us and database is in our local machine then we can establish the connection by using virtual network gateway. (on-premises to azure)


Vnet peerings
-------------
Establish the connection between two virtual networks
two types of vpc peering
1. v-net to v-net (same region, same subscription)
2. global vnet peering (diff region, diff subscription) via virtual network gateway

east us --> GatewaySubnet --> virtual network gateways1(VPN-RouteBased) <==> virtual network gateways2((VPN-RouteBased)) --> GatewaySubnet --> north europe

(one virtual network gateway takes 25mins to create)

point-to-site ---> individual users can able to connect 
site-to-site  ---> multiple users can able to connect at a time

 
Load balancing --- distribute the traffic to backend pools like vms
---------------
1. azure load balancer (can handle traffic in one region) works at tcp, udp protocols (L4-Transport Layer)

configure this components...
1. frontend ip address
2. backend pool
3. loadbalancing rules
4. health probes

2. traffic manager - dns based routing methods like performance, priority, geographic, weighted (can handle traffic in diff regions) works at http, https(L7-Application Layer)

3. application gateway -- Regional Layer L7 -- SSL/TLS offloading
 
4. front door -- Global layer L7 -- SSL/TLS offloading



Azure monitor --- like cloudwatch in aws
-----------------------------------------
To monitor our applications and infrastructure.
it will track whatever and whoever actions performing on azure resources in azure account

Activity Log ---> like cloud trail in aws  ---> user performs any activity
Alerts
Metrics
logs


Go to any resource what you created ----> enable insights of left navigation

insights
alerts
metrics



Log Analytics Workspace -- Pay-as-you-go
-----------------------
It is the logical storage unit where your log data is collected and stored. (azure monitor logs you can easily store, retain and query)

Write Qeries by using -- kusto query language 


api management services  ------- like gateway
------------------------
It will take 25mins to create
to expose apis via internet



Azure Active Directory  -------- like Iam in aws
----------------------
users -- sign-ins -- MFA
groups -- manager, owner, roles
give access to users and groups like contributor, owner, reader

roles and administrators manage AAD like APP admin, billing admin, global admin and reader...etc
Iam-Roles manage resources

App registrations (service principal) to give access to third party services/tools
Example:
when hitting the azure web app url it authenticates AAD and redirect to our url application via app registrations

Azure AD Connect(you should be a gloal admin role): 
-----------------
AAD is in azure portal
AD is in vm ----> want to sync vm users, groups to AAD



Function App ----> similar to App service like lambda in aws 
-------------
host your applications in function app (or) app service.
two types of hosting plans
consumption plan -- serverless (schedule at particular time)
app service plan (continuosly running on server 24/7)



Service Bus -- like sns and sqs in aws
-----------
Topic(Single sender to multiple receivers)
Queue(Single sender to single receiver)
Enable partioning when you create topic and queue it will multiply 16 into how much gb.


Logic Apps
----------
Step by step actions to be performed (Trigger/Scheduling)
create logical app designer
Scenario1: move azure blobs data from hot tier to cold tier to archieve tier when last modified data less than 7 days
Scenario2: want to list azure key vault keys and upload to storage account under container and send the gmail
